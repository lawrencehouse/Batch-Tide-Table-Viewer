# Batch Tide Graphic Viewer

## Overview
Looking at many different tide forecasting websites, I found that there are hardly any that show multiple areas you want to observe at once. My Capstone will be bridging the gap mentioned. It will present a graphic representing the High and Low tides for up to 3 areas in the United States and US territories at once.

 ### Possible APIs
  - [Accuweather Tidal Data](https://apidev.accuweather.com/developers/TidalForecastApi)
  - [World Tide Data (paid)](https://www.worldtides.info/apidocs)
  - [NOAA Tide Data](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/)

## Functionality
Users will be able to enter the zip-code/city/state for the areas they want to view and have the data post to the page.



## Data Model
 - Using TidedataAPI to request High and Low tide of locations
 - Model containing the date range requested by the user
